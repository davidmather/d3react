# d3react
<p>This is an example project to demonstrate using React and d3.js. React is a javascript polyfill. All react scripts must be compiled to pure javascript in order to run correctly. Furthermore in order to run correctly the following scripts must be run on a server. I have used php as an example feel free to change the extension as desired.</p>
